City Fibre - No Connection Diagnostics: This guide's purpose is to help you understand how to diagnose and troubleshoot an issue, when there is no connection on a City Fibre service.
City Fibre - No Connection Diagnostics: What Is a No Connection Fault on a City Fibre Service?: For City Fibre, an issue impacting the customer's connection could be caused by one of two reasons
City Fibre - No Connection Diagnostics: What Is a No Connection Fault on a City Fibre Service?: Supplier: If it appears that the service and other nearby connections have suddenly disconnected, then the issue could be due to the supplier and a Fault will need to be raised to City Fibre to investigate.
City Fibre - No Connection Diagnostics: What Is a No Connection Fault on a City Fibre Service?: Internal Issues: The Customer router, City Fibre ONT and any connecting cables that are required for a working service, could cause a loss of connection should anything be faulty. Around 90% of calls are resolved without an engineer when diagnostics are completed. For this reason, it's important to eliminate all internal issues before raising a fault to City Fibre, by performing diagnostics.
City Fibre - No Connection Diagnostics: Customer Diagnostics to Perform: ONT Diagnostics: There are diagnostics we can perform with the City Fibre ONT: we should try to perform these when possible and then reboot the router before retesting. Please remember that the general rule to follow is. If all 4 lights on the ONT are green it is likely a problem beyond the ONT (on the router/device side) causing no connection.
City Fibre - No Connection Diagnostics: Customer Diagnostics to Perform: Router Factory Reset: We can rule out a potential issue with Fritz!Box software causing no connection by performing a Factory Reset. Please keep in mind that if we conduct a Factory Reset on a Fritz!Box for a City Fibre customer, we should allow UMP to configure this on our behalf and not manually configuring any routers.
City Fibre - No Connection Diagnostics: Customer Diagnostics to Perform: Test an alternative Router: Should we have exhausted all of our options regarding the diagnostics we can do with a customer's devices and router configuration. Then we should look to try an alternative router or perhaps send a Loan Router. When it comes to City Fibre we can only recommend to use any Fritz!Box Router or the Technicolor DGA4134, as they use are configured for City Fibre Auto Configuration.
City Fibre - ONT Overview: This guide's purpose is to overview the ONT that is supplied with every City Fibre service. We will also delve into the functions of the hardware and how to diagnose any potential issues with this.

City Fibre - ONT Overview: The Lights: There are only 4 lights on the City Fibre ONT. However, each light can have different states which all indicate different things
City Fibre - ONT Overview: The Lights: Power Light: Green - ONT is on and boot up is complete. Flashing Green - ONT is booting up. Amber - ONT is performing a firmware upgrade. Light will stay Amber until the ONT has upgraded its firmware.; Flashing Amber - ONT is performing a software image boot test.; Red - ONT has failed to boot up.; Off - there is no power to the ONT.
City Fibre - ONT Overview: The Lights: Broadband Light: Green - The Optical link to the exchange is working and recognises your ONT.; Flashing Green - The ONT is in the process of establishing an Optical link to the exchange.; Flashing Red and Green - The Optical link is detected, but cannot establish a stable link, due to errors, low light levels, or no negotiation.; Off - No Optical or Ethernet connection is detected.
City Fibre - ONT Overview: The Lights: Service Light: Green - The ONT Ethernet port is active and ready for the router to connect to the network.; Off - The ONT Ethernet port is not provisioned/active.

City Fibre - ONT Overview: Diagnostics We Can Do: Restart: Should the customer be having any issues with the ONT then the customer can restart this. To conduct a reboot on the City Fibre ONT, the customer just needs to disconnect the power cable from the underside, for 1 minute, then reconnect this to turn the device back on.
City Fibre - ONT Overview: Diagnostics We Can Do: Reset Button: There is a Reset hole on the face of the ONT. Pressing and holding the button within this for this for 10 - 15 seconds will reset the ONT.
City Fibre - ONT Overview: Diagnostics We Can Do: Alternative Power Source: Should there be no power to the ONT, as there is no Battery Backup Unit we could test via another mains power socket. However if we have conducted all diagnostics with no fix to any power issues, then we should be raising a fault to City Fibre to have the ONT replaced.
City Fibre - ONT Overview: Diagnostics We Can Do: Customers are not to tamper with the Optical Cable.
FTTP - Performance Diagnostics: Whilst FTTP is less prone to degradation or interference, performance issues can still occur on these services.
FTTP - Performance Diagnostics: If a customer reports that they're not getting the full speeds that their product is supposed to have, or have general browsing issues, then it could be affected by a performance problem. This guide should cover all the checks our customers can run through and all the checks that we can do to try and resolve any performance issues that may be experienced, before potentially raising a fault to the FMs.
FTTP - Performance Diagnostics: What is a Performance Fault for FTTP?: FTTP performance faults can be caused by anything, from the customer's devices to the extenal network from our suppliers. We can split the diagnostics we conduct into three categories based on their potential cause.
FTTP - Performance Diagnostics: What is a Performance Fault for FTTP?: Supplier: An issue with the supplier often will give the customer an experience that their speeds are below the 'minimum that we guarentee', even after completing all other diagnostic checks. Keep in mind these minimum speeds are only for peak hours. If the customer is seeing slow speeds outside of the 3 busiest hours of the day this should still be investigated as an issue.
FTTP - Performance Diagnostics: What is a Performance Fault for FTTP?: Provisioning Error: Sometimes we can encounter provisioning errors either with the service being activated incorrect causing a reduction in speeds. Or perhaps with the service being provisioned on the incorrect package therefore capping the service at a lower speed regardless of the diagnostic checks we or the customer performs.
FTTP - Performance Diagnostics: What is a Performance Fault for FTTP?: Internal Issues: Customer software, hardware and networking can have a significant impact on performance. Around 90% of calls are resolved without an engineer when diagnostics are completed. For this reason, it's important to eliminate all possible diagnostics before raising a fault to our suppliers.
FTTP - Performance Diagnostics: What is a Performance Fault for FTTP?: It is important not to 'drip-feed' diagnostics to customers and try to advice of all the possibile diagnostics we may go through in the initial contact.
FTTP - Performance Diagnostics: Customer-Side Checks: There are certain checks we can ask customers to do on their side of the network. If the customer agrees we can walk through these with them.
FTTP - Performance Diagnostics: Customer-Side Checks: Standard FTTP diagnostics: Run a Speedtest: To establish a baseline for what the customer currently sees it is best to run a speedtest on the appropriate site as per the supplier. If there's a time-related pattern to the issue explain we need speed test results during when the problem occurs. If none get close to the top speed for the product, at various times of the day, then we should look at the possibility this issue exists elsewhere.
FTTP - Performance Diagnostics: Customer-Side Checks: Standard FTTP diagnostics: Reset the ONT: We can conduct a diagnostic step to Factory Reset with the ONT, when all lights show a working service.
FTTP - Performance Diagnostics: Customer-Side Checks: Standard FTTP diagnostics: Simplifying The Network: It is important for high speed services to always ensure that the customer has an optimized setup between the ONT and their devices to get the best speed achievable.
FTTP - Performance Diagnostics: Customer-Side Checks: Standard FTTP diagnostics: Test alternative equipment: If a speed test seems stuck at a certain speed such as 100mbps or unable to reach beyond a speed far less then the expected range. We should be ensuring to test an alternative device, Ethernet cable or router to ensure the tested equipment is not at fault. PC Specs guide. It is important for FTTP services above 100mbps to be using a Cat6 Ethernet cable or higher.
FTTP - Performance Diagnostics: Customer-Side Checks: Remember these checks are customer-side checks but it's possible for issues to exist outside of the customer's control.
City Fibre - No Connection Diagnostics: This guide's purpose is to help you understand how to diagnose and troubleshoot an issue, when there is no connection on a City Fibre service.
City Fibre - No Connection Diagnostics: What Is a No Connection Fault on a City Fibre Service?: For City Fibre, an issue impacting the customer's connection could be caused by one of two reasons.
City Fibre - No Connection Diagnostics: What Is a No Connection Fault on a City Fibre Service?: Supplier: If it appears that the service and other nearby connections have suddenly disconnected, then the issue could be due to the supplier and a Fault will need to be raised to City Fibre to investigate.
City Fibre - No Connection Diagnostics: What Is a No Connection Fault on a City Fibre Service?: Internal Issues: The Customer router, City Fibre ONT and any connecting cables that are required for a working service, could cause a loss of connection should anything be faulty. Around 90% of calls are resolved without an engineer when diagnostics are completed. For this reason, it's important to eliminate all internal issues before raising a fault to City Fibre, by performing diagnostics.
City Fibre - No Connection Diagnostics: Customer Diagnostics to Perform: ONT Diagnostics: There are diagnostics we can perform with the City Fibre ONT: we should try to perform these when possible and then reboot the router before retesting. Please remember that the general rule to follow is. If all 4 lights on the ONT are green it is likely a problem beyond the ONT (on the router/device side) causing no connection.
City Fibre - No Connection Diagnostics: Customer Diagnostics to Perform: Router Factory Reset: We can rule out a potential issue with Fritz!Box software causing no connection by performing a Factory Reset. Please keep in mind that if we conduct a Factory Reset on a Fritz!Box for a City Fibre customer, we should allow UMP to configure this on our behalf and not manually configuring any routers.
City Fibre - No Connection Diagnostics: Customer Diagnostics to Perform: Test an alternative Router: Should we have exhausted all of our options regarding the diagnostics we can do with a customer's devices and router configuration. Then we should look to try an alternative router or perhaps send a Loan Router. When it comes to City Fibre we can only recommend to use any Fritz!Box Router or the Technicolor DGA4134, as they use are configured for City Fibre Auto Configuration.
Diagnostic Help - Speedtesting: We have a new & more reliable way of testing perfomance. Using Ookla, we now have a Zen hosted speed test server, accessed via [https://zen-internet.speedtestcustom.com/](https://zen-internet.speedtestcustom.com/) or through speedtest.net.
Diagnostic Help - Speedtesting: Zen customers using this test do not leave the Zen network. This means the test is more accurate, reliable and capable of getting up to (and beyond) the fastest Retail product we sell today, FTTP 900.
Diagnostic Help - Speedtesting: The URL for customers to use is [https://zen-internet.speedtestcustom.com/](https://zen-internet.speedtestcustom.com/). Or if you don't like the URL you can use [https://speedtest.net](https://speedtest.net) and change the server to 'Zen Internet'.
Diagnostic Help - Speedtesting: Changing Servers: If you've arrived through speedtest.net the chosen server doesn't default to Zen Internet, click 'Change Server'. When using our customer link the same option is accessed through the drop down arrow.
Diagnostic Help - Speedtesting: Select Host: In the Dialogue box that appears search for 'Zen Internet' and there will only be one result with a server in London. Clicking this result sets the server to Zen's.
Diagnostic Help - Speedtesting: Results: The test runs and the results are displayed a few moments later. Please remember this isn’t a magic speed test which eliminates the need for performance diagnostics, testing with a cable direct into the router, nothing else using the network, a freshly rebooted device, ideally running in safe mode along with all of the standard performance diags. A high latency/jitter can indicate there's either a problem with the service or bandwidth is being saturated.
Diagnostic Help - Speedtesting: If the customer receives receive the message "Unable to connect, please try again later.", they may be running a firewall or a network configuration which is preventing the tester from connecting. If the Internet access is restricted via a web proxy server only, they will not be able to run this test.

[CyberCheck FAQs](https://www.zen.co.uk/help-support/CyberCheck)
CyberCheck FAQs: What is the CyberCheck Service?: The CyberCheck solution is a passive-service, that uses automated, real-time web-domain monitoring to provide businesses with the tools to protect against potential Phishing, Hacking and Ransomware threats.
CyberCheck FAQs: How is a threat identified using CyberCheck?: The platform uses automated analysis methods to seek out and identify potential compromises across a variety of Internet sources. After collecting this data, the service will send an alert notification if any look-alike domains (including SSL certs) and data breaches have been detected.
CyberCheck FAQs: Exposed Credentials Alert: What Does This Mean?: Some of your company email accounts have been included in a newly discovered data leak. These email accounts are often accompanied by passwords and other personal information which can be used to access your systems such as email, servers and more.
CyberCheck FAQs: Exposed Credentials Alert: What Has Triggered This?: We constantly search for data leaks across all parts of the internet (Clearnet, darknet and deep web) and when we find a leak, we automatically cross check your email accounts against the leak. When we find a match, the notification you have received is automatically sent.
CyberCheck FAQs: Exposed Credentials Alert: Is This Part of a Bigger Malicious Campaign?: Exposed credentials are common, most people’s email accounts have appeared in multiple data leaks. It is unlikely that this is part of a wider malicious campaign.
CyberCheck FAQs: Exposed Credentials Alert: What Has Been Done About This?: Once the details are leaked, it is nearly impossible to take them down. We advise taking the steps below to minimise any impact from this: 1. If a requirement for employees to change passwords on a regular basis is not in place, trigger mandatory password resets for all employees 2. Implement two/multi factor authentication or regular, mandatory password changes 3. If not already implemented, enforce a rule that employees can not use company email accounts for personal use 4. Implement password managers to allow users to easily create unique and secure passwords for different accounts
CyberCheck FAQs: Exposed Credentials Alert: Why Should I Care?: One of the most common routes for a malicious actor to gain access to systems such as email, servers and more is via ‘credential stuffing’ which relies on the victim having used the same email and password combination (credentials) for multiple accounts. If the credentials are exposed, these are often tried in various places to gain access. This can give a malicious actor the opportunity to access your systems such as email, servers and more which can lead to a significant and costly incident.
CyberCheck FAQs: Exposed Credentials Alert: What Else Can I Do To Prevent This Happening Again?: 1. If a requirement for employees to change passwords on a regular basis is not in place, trigger mandatory password resets for all employees 2. Implement two/multi factor authentication or regular, mandatory password changes 3. If not already implemented, enforce a rule that employees can not use company email accounts for personal use Implement password managers to allow users to easily create unique and secure passwords for different accounts
CyberCheck FAQs: Impersonation Alert: What Does This Mean?: Someone has registered a new website or activated an existing one which seems to closely resemble your brand. This is commonly an attempt to target your customers and/or employees designed to dupe them into submitting their details for the purposes of crime such as to gain access to your systems or to defraud the victims.
CyberCheck FAQs: Impersonation Alert: What Has Triggered This?: We constantly cross check your brand against all newly registered domains and SSL certificates looking for matches to your brand, including typos and variations. When we find a match, the notification you have received is automatically sent.
CyberCheck FAQs: Impersonation Alert: Is This Part of a Bigger Malicious Campaign?: If you are seeing this alert happening more than three times in a month, this is likely part of a sustained campaign to target your brand.
CyberCheck FAQs: Impersonation Alert: What Has Been Done About This?: We have already actioned a takedown of the relevant website and no further action is required.
CyberCheck FAQs: Impersonation Alert: Why Should I Care?: Typically, these websites are linked to an email campaign or paid for advert targeting your customers and/or employees designed to duping them into submitting their details for the purposes of crime such as to gain access to your systems or to defraud the victims. Although it is not your company committing the crime, many victims report losing faith in the actual business after an incident. If you employees submit their login details, this can give a malicious actor the opportunity to access your systems such as email, servers and more which can lead to a significant and costly incident.
CyberCheck FAQs: Impersonation Alert: What Else Can I Do To Prevent This Happening Again?: Although identifying and taking down the websites as they are registered is a fantastic approach, we also recommend educating your customers and employees on how to spot phishing emails. Often, companies commission ‘phishing simulation’ tests on their employees to test their resilience to fraudulent emails (phishing emails).
[Do Zen Block Any Ports](https://www.zen.co.uk/help-support/do-zen-block-any-ports)
Do Zen Block Any Ports: What ports do we block?: Zen block the ports between 135-139 on UDP and TCP, at the outside of our gateway servers. This means traffic on these ports between our gateways, other Zen servers and the global Internet, would be blocked.
Do Zen Block Any Ports: Why we block these ports?: These blocks are in place as Microsoft Software uses these to broadcast packets of information. If these ports were not blocked, they could potentially add a large number of un-necessary traffic on our our network.
Do Zen Block Any Ports: What do I do if I need to use these ports? If you need to use these ports for an application e.g. a Microsoft service running between two sites, we advise you to configure VPN access between the sites. This would allow traffic on ports between the two sites.
[Open Recursive DNS](https://www.zen.co.uk/help-support/open-recursive-dns)
Open Recursive DNS: What is DNS?: To find a Web site, e.g www.zen.co.uk, a computer needs to translate the domain name www.zen.co.uk into a series of numbers, called an IP address. This IP address can be used by a computer to find where a site is and how to send information to and from it. To achieve this task, a computer sends the name www.zen.co.uk to an Internet server called a Domain Name Service (DNS). The DNS server's job is to translate the domain name, into the IP address. To do this the DNS server has a list of domain names and IP addresses so it can look them up and return the IP address to your device.
Open Recursive DNS: What is an Open Recursive DNS Server? A recursive DNS server is a device which is able to translate domain names to IP addresses when told to do so much like a DNS. However if it does not have the right information, it will contact other DNS servers then pass the information on. An Open Recursive DNS server will respond to anyone with this information. Anyone in the world can ask this server to translate the domain name to IP address and it will respond to them with the answer.
Open Recursive DNS: Why is it a problem? It is possible for someone to send a request to the DNS server and make it look like it has come from someone else, so the response from the server can go to the wrong person. This causes problems when people maliciously use this to attack remote networks. For example if 200 servers were responding at the same time, to the same connection, it could easily bring down a large company's Internet connection.
Open Recursive DNS: How do I know if I'm affected? If we have identified that you are using a Recursive DNS Server. You should have had an email from us. In this email we will have provided you instructions on what this means and how to fix it.
Open Recursive DNS: How am I contributing to it? If your Broadband service is responding to DNS requests, it means there is something at the end of your connection acting as an open recursive DNS Server. This means you might be included without your knowledge in an attack on another company’s network as described above. In addition to affecting another networks, it would also degrade your connection to the extent where it could become slow or unstable.
Open Recursive DNS: How am I contributing to it? There are several reasons why your line might respond like an open recursive DNS server; You may have a virus. A virus may be responding to the DNS requests. If this is the case, running a virus scan using the latest virus definitions available on all devices on your network should find and remove the virus. You may have a recursive DNS server running. If this is the case you will need to restrict the server to only reply to known sources or install software to protect against the server being exploited in this way. Unfortunately Zen cannot advise any further on this issue. Your Broadband hardware may be responding. Some routers are set to respond to DNS requests by default. In most cases this function can be turned off by logging into the router and setting it to not respond to DNS requests. For more information on how to do this please contact the hardware manufacturer for advice.
[Auto compensations FAQs](https://www.zen.co.uk/help-support/auto-compensation-faq)
Auto compensations FAQs: What is auto compensation?: The new Ofcom voluntary auto compensation scheme went live on April 1 2019, and we’ve signed up to it. If you’re a residential or small business landline or broadband customer, you’ll be eligible to receive automatic compensation when our service to you falls short of expected standards.
Auto compensations FAQs: Do I need to do anything?: You don’t need to do anything to qualify for auto compensation. We think it’s a faster, fairer and more efficient way to compensate customers when something goes wrong, and because it’s automatic you don’t need to make a claim or sign up to anything.
Auto compensations FAQs: When will I receive compensation, and how much will I get?: You'll be entitled to automatic compensation if any of the following happen: 1) Delayed provision: If you’re promised that a new service will go live on a particular date and it doesn’t, you’ll receive £5.83 per day (including the missed start date) until the service starts. You won’t receive compensation for the day the service starts. So, for example, if your new service is due to go live on a Tuesday but is delayed until Friday, you’d get £17.49. If provision is delayed because you miss your appointment, the compensation calculation will be paused, and will only resume if activation is not completed at the next engineer visit. You won't receive compensation if you don't accept the earliest reappointment date (where applicable).
Auto compensations FAQs: When will I receive compensation, and how much will I get?: You'll be entitled to automatic compensation if any of the following happen: 2) Delayed repair: If your service stops working (total loss of service) and isn’t fixed within two working days of reporting the fault, you’ll automatically receive £9.33 per day for each day until the fault is repaired. You won’t receive compensation for the day the fault is fixed. So, for example, if you report a fault on a Monday, we’ll have until 23.59 on Wednesday to get it fixed. If we don’t, you’ll receive compensation for every full day after that until the fault is fixed. If you report the fault on a Friday, we’ll have until 23.59 on Tuesday. You won't receive compensation if: You haven't reported the fault to us. The fault is within your own property (like WiFi issues or internal wiring, for example). You don't accept the earliest reappointment date (where applicable). What is a 'total loss of service'? For broadband - a service fault outside your property that prevents you from accessing the internet. For phone - a service fault outside your property that prevents you from making or receiving calls. If you experience a total loss of service on your phone line and broadband service at the same time, the maximum credit you receive will be fixed at £9.33 per day.
Auto compensations FAQs: When will I receive compensation, and how much will I get?: You'll be entitled to automatic compensation if any of the following happen: 3) Missed appointments: If an engineer doesn’t turn up for a scheduled appointment, or the appointment is cancelled with less than 24 hours’ notice, you’ll receive £29.15 compensation. You won't receive compensation if you receive more than 24-hours' notice of a change or cancellation of appointment, or if you miss the appointment.
Auto compensations FAQs: How will I receive my compensation?: If you’re eligible to receive compensation (based on any of the above scenarios), it will be automatically credited to your next bill after the missed appointment, activation date or fix.
Auto compensations FAQs: Can I query my compensation?: We will always credit your compensation to you as quickly as possible. However, we understand that you may wish to query the amount you have (or haven’t) received. In the event of a delayed repair or provision, please wait 15 full days from the date of repair or activation. To query a missed appointment, please wait 7 full days. After this time, please contact us and we will do our best to help you.
Auto compensations FAQs: How much compensation can I receive?: For delayed repair or provision, compensation is calculated to the date the fault or provision is completed. For missed appointments, you will receive £29.15 in each instance. Additionally, for delayed repairs, if we are unable to fix your service after 30 days you will be entitled to leave Zen with no termination charges.
Auto compensations FAQs: What happens if I cancel?: In the event that you cancel your order or service prior to completion or repair, you may still be eligible to receive compensation. For delayed orders, you will be compensated up to the cancellation date. When a faulty service is ceased, you will be compensated up to the service cease date or repair date (whichever comes first).
The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) sets rules about how companies advertise broadband speeds. They must show the average speed that at least 50% of their customers receive at the network’s busiest time (8-10pm).
You may not get the maximum speed advertised on the competitor's broadband package. This is because the speed you get depends on a number of factors, including the distance from your local telephone exchange or street cabinet, the wiring in your home, the number of people using the network and even the time of day.
Competitor's speeds may be advertised as 'up to' a certain speed. This means that the speed you get could be much lower than the maximum advertised speed.
Many broadband providers raise their prices mid-contract. This can leave you paying more than you expected. We guarantee that the price you pay for your broadband will stay the same for the duration of your contract. Providers that raise there prices include: BT; Plusnet; EE; Vodafone; TalkTalk; Sky; Virgin Media.

[How to Identify a Phishing Email](https://www.zen.co.uk/help-support/how-to-identify-a-phishing-email)
How to Identify a Phishing Email: 1 - What are Phishing Emails: Phishing emails aim to extract sensitive user information to be used in ransomware and identity attacks. As with any other email services, criminals could even try to pose as Zen to extract your customer's information. Zen will never send unsolicited email asking for your password for services that you have with us. The only exception may be during the course of a contact to us where we may need to confirm your account details.
How to Identify a Phishing Email: 2 - Recognizing a Phishing Email: There are a number of common things you can look out for to identify a phishing email: They will be received without prior contact from you. Some claim that your service has been, or will be suspended, should you fail to confirm your details. Others will claim a new service is being introduced, or an existing one being changed, and you need to confirm your details to use it, or upgrade. The reply address of the email may be wrong, e.g. 'ZenMailSupport@gmail.com' instead of 'support@zen.co.uk'. They may contain a 'click here' link, if you select or hover your mouse over the link you will see the website could be a completely unfamiliar domain which the attacker has compromised. This is rather than a Zen domain, e.g. '.zen.co.uk' or '.zeninternet.co.uk'.
How to Identify a Phishing Email: 3 - How to Deal with a Phishing Email: If you ever receive an email that says it is from Zen or another company that you are suspicious as to the legitimacy of, please do not reply to it or click on any links within it. Instead, contact the company and someone will verify whether it is an email which has legitimately been sent.

[Managing Domain DNS Records for Home](https://www.zen.co.uk/help-support/managing-domain-dns-records):
Managing Domain DNS Records for Home: What is DNS? DNS (Domain Name System) is responsible for pointing a domain name to a host on the internet. When typing a web address into a browser, a DNS request is sent to find the IP address of the web server it's hosted on. The DNS records for a domain name are held on a Name Server (NS), which are maintained by various 3rd parties. There are also 'authoritative' NS, where DNS records are kept for a domain name. Usually, the authoritative NS for your domain name is looked after by your domain hosting company. These authoritative NS are then checked by 'recursive' NS (such as an ISP) to find out information for that domain name. A Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) refers to an absolute domain name (the domain name in full). It contains information about all the domain levels, such as the top-level domain (TLD) or root zone. A FQDN is represented when a full hostname with all labels (components) of a domain name is present, including a trailing dot (.)
Managing Domain DNS Records for Home: As DNS records can be configured in various ways for different personal and business needs, we provide the tools for our customers to manage their own DNS records.

Managing Domain DNS Records for Home: Address (A) Records: A records are used to link names to IP addresses. This allows a request for a website such as www.zen.co.uk to be directed to a server on the Internet. In the first box, enter the 'Hostname/Subdomain' for the record you wish to create. This is normally something such as 'www', '@', 'mail', or 'ftp'. For the 'IP Address', enter the IP of the server you want the A record to point to.
Managing Domain DNS Records for Home: Mail Exchange (MX) Records: MX records are used by mail servers to direct where to deliver E-mail by pointing to an A or CNAME record, then to the IP address of the E-mail server for the domain. MX records cannot be pointed directly to IP addresses. In the first box, enter the 'Hostname/Subdomain' for the record. This can be anything, but usually should be set to '@'. For the second field, enter the 'Priority'. This must be a number between 1 and 99, lower numbers mean a higher priority. Finally, enter the 'Mail Server' address. This must be a hostname or FQDN (fully qualified domain name).
Managing Domain DNS Records for Home: Canonical Name (CNAME) Records: CNAME records provide an alias functionality to DNS. They can be pointed to A records or other CNAME records. In the first box, enter the 'Hostname Alias' for the record you wish to create. This is normally something such as 'www2', 'mail2', or 'ftp2'. Lastly, enter the 'Actual Name' the CNAME will point to.
Managing Domain DNS Records for Home: Service (SRV) Records: SRV records are specifications of data in the Domain Name System defining the location, i.e. the hostname and port number, of servers for specified services. Set the 'Srvc' symbolic service name for the record you wish to create, such as '\_autodiscover' or '\_sip'. For 'Prot', set the protocol service uses '\_tcp' or '\_udp'. The 'Pri' is the priority of the target host, lower value means more preferred. Set the relative 'Weight' for records with the same priority. The 'Port' can be set to that which the service transmits over (TCP or UDP). For 'Target', set the hostname of the target server. This must point to an A record, this cannot be a CNAME record. This can be set to an external host, if this is done, include a dot (.) at the end of the value.
Managing Domain DNS Records for Home: Text (TXT) Records: The TXT record is used to define text information records which may be used to validate legitimate email sources from a domain. In the first box, enter the 'Hostname/Subdomain' for the record you want to create. This is normally something such as 'www2', '@', 'mail2', or 'ftp2'. For the second field, enter the 'Actual Text' that the TXT will contain.
Managing Domain DNS Records for Home: Location (LOC) Records: A LOC record is a means for providing geographic location to a domain name. It contains WGS84 Latitude, Longitude, and Altitude information with host/subnet physical size and location accuracy. In the first box, enter the 'Hostname/Subdomain' for the record you want to create. This is normally something such as 'www', 'mail', or 'ftp'. Now in the second field, enter the location information as 'Text'. Latitude, followed by Longitude, then Altitude.
Managing Domain DNS Records for Home: Time To Live (TTL) Records: A Time To Live (TTL) is a specification of data in the Domain Name defining the maximum amount of time a DNS record should be cached before being discarded. TTL is measured in seconds, by default this value will be set to 86400, or 24 hours, this lowers the number of queries sent to the DNS server and improves response. In the 'New Value (sec)' box, enter the value in seconds you want the TTL to be. Note: As low values for TTL can cause a high load on the DNS server, changes are automatically reverted to 86400 after seven days.

Domain name transfer guide Transferring a domain name from an existing host to Zen is simple. But before the domain name can be moved you may need to contact your current web hosting provider to either obtain an Auth Code or to change the IPS tags (Internet Provider Security tags), depending on the type of domain you wish to transfer. For .uk domain names Before a domain transfer order can be placed with Zen you will need to arrange for the IPS tag to be changed to ZENSYS. If your current host provides you with an online portal to amend details for your domain name, you may be able to change these details without having to contact them. Once the domain is tagged as ZENSYS you are ready to place your domain transfer order with Zen online and can expect fulfilment of the order within 24 – 48 hours. For non .uk domain names If you wish to transfer a non .uk domain to Zen Internet, you will need to arrange for your current web hosting provider to provide an Auth Code or transfer key before the domain can be released. This code ensures that domains are not transferred away unlawfully and to ensure that only the rightful domain owner can arrange for domains to move providers.
Purchasing EU domains: To comply with new legistation as a result of Brexit you must either be an EU Citizen (if registering as an individual) or have a registered office or principal place of business within the EU. Any .eu domains registered with a UK address will be invalid once the UK leaves the EU and will therefore need updating. Failure to register the domain against a valid EU address may result in the domain being revoked.
